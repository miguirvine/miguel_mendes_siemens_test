# miguel_mendes_siemens_test (question 2)
Contains the implementation for the proposed problems at surveymonkey (question 2).

Usage: Compile the "seq_writer.cpp", "seq_writer.h" and "main.cpp". Running main function will print the results.

Implementation choices:
* I used bitwise operations to reduce the number of comparisons made by the program.
